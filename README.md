## 🔄 Data Cleaning & Preparation

* Converted date fields to datetime format
* Standardised column names
* Created time-based features (year, month)
* Validated numerical fields and handled missing values

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

Key analyses included:

* Monthly revenue trends
* Revenue by product category
* Revenue by customer gender
* Customer age distribution

Visualisations were created using Matplotlib and key insights were documented directly in the notebook.

---

## 🧮 SQL Analysis (SQLite)

SQL was used to calculate business metrics including:

* Total revenue & average order value
* Monthly sales trends
* Revenue by product category

All SQL queries are saved in the file:
`sql_queries.sql`

---

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visualise:

* 📌 Total Revenue & Average Order Value
* 📅 Monthly Sales Trend
* 🛍 Revenue by Product Category
* 👥 Revenue by Gender

---

## 🔍 Key Business Insights

* Electronics is the highest revenue-generating product category.
* Sales peaked in May 2023, suggesting possible seasonality.
* Female customers generated slightly higher revenue than male customers.
* The average customer age indicates a core middle-aged customer base.
* The dataset contains limited data for 2024, so trend analysis focuses primarily on 2023.
